## 🚀 Current project

### 🧗‍♂️ Bouldering Gym Application

In my free time, I’m building an application for **bouldering gyms**, where:

- climbers can **log their climbs**
- track **progress over time**
- engage with and **be part of their gym community**
- stay motivated through data and social features

The goal is to connect **climbing, progress tracking, and community** in a single platform.
